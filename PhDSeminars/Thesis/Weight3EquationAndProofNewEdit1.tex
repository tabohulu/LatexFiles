\section{Equation and Proof}
\begin{theorem}
Let $Q(x) =x^{a\tau+t}(1+x^{\beta \tau +1}+x^{\gamma \tau +2})$ be the polynomial representation of a weight $3$ RTZ input.
The Hamming weight, $w_H$ of a turbo codeword generated by a weight-$3$ RTZ input is given by 
\begin{equation}
7+2(l+l')
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since the impulse response is
\[
(1~1~1~0~1~1~0~1~1~0~\cdots)
\]
Let $\bh_1=(1~1~1)$, $\bh_2=(0~1~1)$, $\bh_3=(0~0~1)$, $\bphi_1 = (0~1~1)$, $\bphi_2 = (1~0~1)$, and $\bphi_3 = (1~1~0)$. Then, the weight-3 RTZ occurs since $\bphi_1+\bphi_2+\bphi_3=\bzero_3$.

Now, we consider the weight of the vector derived by the sumation of the followings vectors.
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_1~\bphi_1~\cdots)\cr
(\bzero_{3j}~\bh_2~\bphi_2~\cdots)\cr
(\bzero_{3k}~\bh_3~\bphi_3~\cdots)
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{Case 1: $i=j=k$ \newline}
 For this case, the derived vector will be $(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_3~\bzero_{3}~\cdots)$ with a weight of $2$

\paragraph{Case 2: $i<j,~j=k$ \newline}
For this case, the derived vector will be $(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_1 ~ (\bh_2)_{j-i-1}~\bh_3~\bzero_{3}~\cdots)$ and the weight can be calculated as $$w_p=2(j-i)+2$$


\paragraph{Case 3: $i<j<k$ \newline}
For this case, the derived vector will be $(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_1 ~ (\bh_2)_{j-i-1}~\bzero_{3}~(\bphi_3)_{k-j-1}~\bh_1~\bzero_{3}~\cdots )$. To calculate the weight of this derived vector, we get $2(j-1)+1$(weight for $(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_1 ~ (\bh_2)_{j-i-1}~\bzero_{3}$) and $2(k-j)+1$ which is the weight for $((\bphi_3)_{k-j-1}~\bh_1~\bzero_{3}~\cdots )$. Therefore the hamming weight will be $$w_p=2(k-i)+2$$


\paragraph{Case 4: $i<k<j$ \newline}
For this case, the derived vector will be $(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_1~(\bh_2)_{k-i-1}~ (0~1~0)~(\bphi_2)_{j-k-1} ~\bphi_3~\bzero_3~\cdots)$. 
The weight for this derived vector is the summation of $2(k-i)+2$ (the weight for $(\bzero_{3i}~\bh_1~(\bh_2)_{k-i-1}~ (0~1~0))$) and $2(j-k)$ ,(which is the weight for $((\bphi_2)_{j-k-1} ~\bphi_3~\bzero_3~\cdots)$). Therefore the hamming weight will be $$w_p=2(j-i)+2$$

From the above cases, we conclude that the parity weight of a weight-$3$ RTZ input will be $$ w_p =2(\max\{k,j\}-i)+2$$
Let $i',k',j',w'_p$ be similarly defind and correspond to a weight $3$-RTZ input derived after interleaving. Then
$$ w'_p =2(\max\{k',j'\}-i')+2$$
In this case, the hamming weight of the turbo codeword will be 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
w_H&=3+w_p+w'_p\\
&=3 + 2(\max\{k,j\}-i)+2+ 2(\max\{k',j'\}-i')+2\\
&=7+2((\max\{k,j\}-i)+(\max\{k',j'\}-i'))\\
&=7+2(l+l')
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $l=(\max\{k,j\}-i)~\text{and}~l'=(\max\{k',j'\}-i')$

\end{proof}
